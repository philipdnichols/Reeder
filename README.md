###Reading Log View
* Table view of reading logs.
* Cell image should be a thumbnail of the cover of the item read if available.
* Cell should have the main detail text be the title of the item read.
* Cell should have the sub detail text be the date and time (8/7/14 10:32 PM) of the item read.
* More details to include if possible: length of time read, chapters read, etc.?
* Reading logs can be deleted from the table view after confirming an alert of some kind (swipe left to delete only)
* The table view should be searchable (search bar above table view)
 * Reading logs should be searchable against title, author, tags, notes and any details contained within the actual reading item associated with the log
* New logs can be entered via a "+" button in the right bar button. This will segue modally to the Log Edit View.
* The navigation bar will display "Reading Log" as the title.
* Existing logs can be selected by tapping on the row. This will push segue to the Log Detail View.
* The table view of reading logs can be sorted in many different ways, all asc/desc toggleable: date (default), length of log, by reading item title, by reading item author, page count of log, type of log (book, article, e-book, magazine, etc.)
* Table view sections should be created based on the table sorting currently applied. For example, if you are sorting by reading item title, each section should be the title of the reading item of the logs.
* The reading log that is currently active will always appear at the top of the table.
* Stretch features:
 * There should be a way to get from a reading log item cell to the reading item itself (info disclosure or a swipe left item besides delete?)
